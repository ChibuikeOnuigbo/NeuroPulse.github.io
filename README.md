Neuro Pulse – Study A.I Companion

Problem:
Every day, thousands of students miss important updates because they rarely check their emails.
Class changes, assignment deadlines, or event notices get lost in their inboxes.
On top of that, managing timetables, remembering schedules, and staying focused can be stressful.
Most tools online are either too complex or not made for students.
We saw this gap — and decided to fill it.

Our Vision & Solution:
Our team, Neuro Pulse, is building Study A.I Companion — a voice-based, intelligent assistant made specially for students.

Imagine an app that:

Checks your school email automatically, and talks to you when a new message arrives.

Reads your timetable, even from a PDF or Excel sheet, and reminds you of your next class.

Answers your questions like a smart study buddy.

And even runs quietly in the background — always ready to help you stay organized and alert.

You don’t need to open your mail or check reminders anymore — Study A.I Companion becomes your personal talking assistant through your whole academic journey.

Core Features (For the Hackathon Demo):

Email monitoring and voice alerts.

A.I timetable reading and reminders.


Local data saving for privacy and speed.

Future & Premium Plans:
After the hackathon, we plan to expand Study A.I Companion with:

A premium version.

Smart voice conversation system.

To add new study features.

Advanced voice commands to open apps or manage files.

A study motivation coach that encourages focus and rest.

Study mode.

Buddy mode.

Focus Check and question generation.

Automatic mail summariser to save students time.

We may not complete all of these now, but our goal is to deliver a strong, working demo that proves how powerful this idea can become.

Impact:
Study A.I Companion aims to transform how students manage their academic life.
It brings together education, productivity, and A.I in one helpful companion.
We want to make school life easier, reduce missed updates, and help students focus on what truly matters — learning.

By building this, we hope to inspire universities, investors, and students alike to see the future of smart learning support.
This is not just another app — it’s the start of a smarter study experience, powered by Neuro Pulse.
