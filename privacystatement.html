    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-10-19</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>NeuroPulse Mail is a privacy-first application. We prioritize keeping your account credentials and tokens on your device and do not sell, share, or monetize your personal email content. This Privacy Policy describes what data the App accesses, how it is stored, and the controls available to you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data the App may access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authenticated email metadata and content:</strong> When you authorize NeuroPulse Mail via OAuth or App Passwords, the App can access message metadata and content to provide summarization and prioritization features (via Gmail API or Microsoft Graph).</li>
        <li><strong>Local tokens and credentials:</strong> OAuth tokens and any account credentials you provide are stored locally on your device in encrypted storage (for example, encrypted SQLite or token.json protected by device-level encryption where available).</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration and usage settings:</strong> Local preferences, voice settings, and AI provider configuration saved on your device to preserve behavior and usability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How data is processed</h2>
      <p>All primary processing is performed on the user's device. Optional AI processing may be routed to configured third-party AI providers (for example, OpenRouter or Google Gemini) when enabled by the user. When AI providers process content, minimal required data is transmitted under the terms and privacy practices of those providers. API keys and service credentials are read from a local .env file (not uploaded to any third party by the App).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Local storage and security</h2>
      <p>Tokens and credentials are stored locally and encrypted. Common storage mechanisms include encrypted SQLite or token.json with local encryption applied. Users retain control of their device and may delete tokens or uninstall the App at any time. The App makes reasonable efforts to follow best practices for local encryption, but ultimate security is influenced by device security and user configuration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>NeuroPulse Mail integrates with the following third-party services. Please review their privacy policies for details on how they handle data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google (Gmail API & Google OAuth) — Google’s privacy & terms apply: https://policies.google.com/</li>
        <li>Microsoft (Microsoft Graph & Azure OAuth) — Microsoft’s privacy & terms apply: https://privacy.microsoft.com/</li>
        <li>AI providers (optional): OpenRouter, Google Gemini, or other configured providers — subject to provider policies.</li>
        <li>Edge-TTS (voice synthesis) — local or provider behavior depends on configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No sale or tracking</h2>
      <p>We do not sell personal data or use data for advertising profiling. NeuroPulse Mail is built for productivity, education, and privacy — not for commercial tracking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User controls and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & deletion:</strong> You can delete local tokens and uninstall the App to remove locally stored credentials and settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> You control which AI providers and voice services (if any) the App uses via local configuration.</li>
        <li><strong>Data export:</strong> The App stores user data locally; you may export or copy local configuration or encrypted storage files as permitted by the App's UI.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security practices</h2>
      <p>The developer follows standard security practices for local encryption and secure handling of credentials. However, no system is infallible. Users should follow device best practices (OS updates, disk encryption, strong account passwords) to protect local data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect technical, legal, or operational changes. Material changes will be posted at this location with an updated effective date.</p>
