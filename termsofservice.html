    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-10-19</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Agreement and scope</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of NeuroPulse Mail ("the App"), a software product provided by the developer. By installing, configuring, or using the App, you accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Services provided</h2>
      <p>NeuroPulse Mail provides AI-assisted email summarization, priority detection, and voice-based summaries for supported email services. The App connects to Gmail and Outlook accounts via authorized APIs (Gmail API, Microsoft Graph API) or App Passwords, and operates primarily on the user's device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Account access and authentication</h2>
      <p>Authentication with third-party providers is performed via standard OAuth flows provided by Google and Microsoft. All access tokens and credentials acquired during authentication are stored locally on the user's device in encrypted form (for example, encrypted SQLite or token.json). The App relies on the security measures of those providers for authentication and consent management.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. User responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your device and any credentials used with the App. You must not attempt to bypass authentication, decompile, or otherwise tamper with the App in ways that violate applicable laws or these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Privacy and data handling</h2>
      <p>The App is designed with privacy-first principles. It does not sell user data or track users for advertising. For details on data handling, storage, and third-party services, please see the Privacy Policy at /privacystatement.html.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>All intellectual property rights in the App and its documentation are owned by the developer or licensed to the developer. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use the App as described in these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Disclaimers and limitations</h2>
      <p>The App is provided "as available" and "as-is." To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The developer is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from use of the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>Except where prohibited by applicable law, the developer's total aggregate liability for any claim related to the App will not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts paid by you to the developer in the previous twelve months, or (b) $100 USD.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>These Terms remain in effect until terminated. You may stop using the App at any time. The developer may suspend or discontinue the App or your access if you violate these Terms or where required by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>The developer may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted at this location with an updated effective date. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Governing law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to the developer's location, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. For users, nothing in these Terms limits mandatory rights that cannot be waived under applicable local law.</p>
    </section>
